## 💡 Sample Interactions

### 🎬 Scenario 1: Complex Multi-Agent Rebooking

```python
# Real-world example: Weather cancellation with tight connection
async def handle_complex_rebooking():

    Customer: "My flight AA123 to Paris was cancelled due to weather. 
    I have a connecting flight to Rome at 3 PM - can you help?"
    """
    
    # 🎯 Orchestrator coordinates multiple agents
    flight_status = await flight_ops_agent.check_status("AA123")
    # ✈️ Flight Ops: "Cancelled due to thunderstorms at JFK"
    
    alternatives = await booking_agent.find_alternatives(
        origin="JFK", destination="CDG", 
        connection_city="Rome", connection_time="15:00"
    )
    # 📋 Booking: "Found 3 options with viable connections"
    
    policies = await policy_agent.check_rebooking_rules(

### 🧳 Scenario 2: Intelligent Baggage Recovery

```python
# Proactive baggage tracking with predictive delivery
async def smart_baggage_recovery():
